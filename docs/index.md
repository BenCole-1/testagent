# Docs Index

This index is the top-level navigation for repository documentation.

## Buckets

- `docs/playbooks/` — reusable operational workflows and implementation guides.
- `docs/notes/` — reference notes, captures, and distilled external insights.

## Current documents

1. **Playbooks**
   - [`agent-knowledge-ops.md`](./playbooks/agent-knowledge-ops.md): guide for organizing, indexing, and retrieving knowledge for agent workflows.

2. **Notes**
   - [`yc-20x-company-note.md`](./notes/yc-20x-company-note.md): distilled takeaway and implications from the YC "20x company" transcript.

## Storage model (quick reference)

- Canonical storage is this repository’s file tree.
- Organization happens via folders + file naming + this index.
- Git history is the audit trail for changes over time.
